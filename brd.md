Road Asset Management SaaS
 Date: December 2024
 Version: 1.0
1. Executive Summary
The Road Asset Management SaaS aims to modernize how municipalities, Departments of Transportation (DOTs), and related agencies capture, analyze, and maintain their roadway infrastructures. By combining mobile data collection (camera, LiDAR, accelerometer), cloud-based AI processing, and an AI “vertical agent” (e.g., built on LangChain), the solution delivers actionable insights for road condition monitoring, asset inventory, and maintenance planning.
The key outcome is a cost-effective, scalable system that digitizes manual processes (e.g., road surveys, sign inspections) and enhances decision-making (e.g., scheduling repairs, prioritizing budgets).
 
2. Purpose and Background
2.1 Purpose
●	Provide an end-to-end platform for capturing road condition data, automatically classifying assets and surface distresses, and generating easy-to-consume reports and action items.
●	Reduce operational costs and error rates associated with manual road inspections.
●	Enable data-driven planning for repairing, upgrading, or installing road assets—ultimately improving safety and optimizing public spending.
2.2 Background
●	Current methods involve manual spot checks or expensive third-party surveying vehicles.
●	Municipalities desire a simplified approach with real-time updates, quick data synchronization, and minimal hardware overhead (i.e., a smartphone or tablet with a LiDAR-capable camera).
●	Existing solutions often lack a “smart” decision layer to guide maintenance scheduling or financial planning.
 
3. Business Objectives
1.	Efficiency

○	Reduce the time and cost of performing road asset surveys by up to 50%.
○	Decrease manual data-entry errors through automated AI-driven classification.
2.	Decision Support

○	Provide Pavement Condition Index (PCI) and International Roughness Index (IRI) estimates in near-real time.
○	Enable strategic maintenance planning via an AI vertical agent that can generate summary reports, schedules, and budgeting forecasts.
3.	Scalability and Accessibility

○	Offer a SaaS model that scales from small municipalities to national DOT agencies.
○	Make data accessible via a web-based dashboard and optional mobile companion for in-field verification.
4.	Competitive Differentiation

○	Stand out through advanced AI features (alligator crack detection, sign classification, LiDAR-based severity analysis).
○	Provide an intelligent agent that can answer queries, automate repetitive tasks, and integrate with existing workflows.
 
4. Scope
4.1 In-Scope

○	Provide AI-driven classification of road signs, cracks, and other assets.
○	Return processed results (e.g., condition ratings) to the Web App in real time or via batch.
3.	Web Application

○	Visualize road data on thematic maps with advanced filtering and drill-down.
○	Generate reports, export options (CSV, PDF, GeoJSON, etc.).
○	Manage user roles (Admin, Surveyor, Analyst).
4.	Vertical AI Agent (e.g., LangChain-based)

○	Summarize survey data, recommend maintenance actions.
○	Automate tasks like generating a work order list or budget forecast.
○	Live within the Web App as a specialized module or microservice.
